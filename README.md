# Pygame
My first try at making a simple 2D game using PyGame module of Python

//Controls

in this simple 2D game
LEFT arrow key -> Move LEFT
RIGHT arrow key -> Move RIGHT
UP arrow key -> JUMP
X -> shoot arrow
Z -> shoot arrow

//Objective

To kill dragons and score points

//GameFlow

There are only a fixed number of arrows in the quiver and when you hit a Multiple of 5 score, 5 arrows are added to the quiver,
But if you dont use your arrows judiciously and they get finished, you loose.
You also have only 5 lives which you will loose on contact with a dragon.

PS:- The forest.wav was not added to this repo because it was huge, just comment the forest.wav line in Game.py file or
add a forest ambience.wav file in the folder where you clone these files
